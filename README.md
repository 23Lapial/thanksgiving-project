"chicken.js" was responsible for "constructing a blueprint" where the blue print was an array of coordinate pairs with colors and color sizes associated with them. The coordinates were copied to the clipboard after each click in "canvas.html" using "script.js" as external js. Copying the coords after each click was possible through code I found on stackoverflow. Currently, "chicken.js" does not work as it does not render an image. The needed information needed to draw a turkey were already recorded and reside in the array "drawingBluePrint" in chicken.js . I assumed this assignment was to demonstrate "technical" skills not artistic ability, and this was my attempt using a new technology I was not familiar with. I did not allocate the time to work on this assignment anytime before or after thankgiving break... I am turing in an incomplete, broken product. I hope not using repl was not a problem.
